this is a simple website i am bulding after learning css
i choosed to use my family as an inspiration "The Adetunji's"
after completing the project i decided to change the names as i did not use my real family pictures.
I do beleive nothing has changed as my message is still clear from my quote.....FAMILY is the most important
